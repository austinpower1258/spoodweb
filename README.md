# spoodweb
This repository serves as the frontend client for Spood. It performs the functionality for the idea of Spood, a way to revolutionize shopping for food. The architecture of this project is as follows: (1) Spoodscraper acts as the way for us to retrieve data, which we get from online Yelp photos of different restaurants, and store the image data into a database table and the images themselves in Supabase storage which we can later fetch. (2) SpoodCLIP is the part of the architecture that includes the AI part. It utilizes OpenAI's CLIP model, which takes in images as input, and seeds them with vector encodings into a vector collection, which is later utilized in its search functionality to fetch the most relevant images based on the word or phrase inputed. The second part of SpoodCLIP is the FastAPI server that allows Spoodweb to fetch the most relevant images based on an user inputed phrase or word in the text box. (3) Spoodweb is the client side or frontend part of the application that displays the images and allows users to input words or phrases into a search bar.

## Setup
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start` to start the server. Make sure the FastAPI backend server is running alongside the Docker instance or else the search will not work.
